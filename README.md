# PalworldModdingGuide
A guide on how to mod Palworld. I will be honest I am mainly putting this here so I can keep reminding myself.

# THIS (CURRENTLY) IS FOR CREATING REPLACEMENT MODS ONLY

# Extracting Files
Use FModel - https://fmodel.app

# FModel Notes
Run Fmodel, click on "Add Undetected game", type any name and enter the directory path to Palworld game. Click on the blue plus button.
Unreal Engine version of the Palworld game is 5.1.1, so use GAME_UE5_1 setting.
Go to settings and enable Local Mapping File
Select Mappings.usmap file under Mapping file path
Now you're able to explore game files and export textures/models and stuff!

Note: Fmodel requires .NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime installed on your computer!

# FModel
FModel requires Windows Desktop Runtime 8.0.1 (It should prompt you to download this automatically but I am putting it here just in case)



# Get the right version of Unreal Engine
Current version -> Unreal Engine 5.1.1
