# PalworldModdingGuide
A guide on how to mod Palworld. I will be honest I am mainly putting this here so I can keep reminding myself.

# Extracting Files
Use FModel - https://fmodel.app

# FModel
FModel requires Windows Desktop Runtime 8.0.1 (It should prompt you to download this automatically but I am putting it here incase it does not and you don't already have it)

# Get the right version of Unreal Engine
Current version -> Unreal Engine 5.1.1
